## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MongoDB, Express, EJS, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, Passport

This project uses EJS for the frontend using CSS and JavaScript to give the illusion of a dynamic interface.

The backend follows the MVC architecture. MongoDB was used for the database, Node and Express for the backend server, and Passport for authentication.

# Install

`npm install`

---

# Things to add

- Create a `.env` file in config folder and add the following as `key = value`
  - PORT = 3000 (can be any port example: 5000)
  - DB_STRING = `your database URI`

---

# Run

`npm start`


## Optimizations

This project can be further improved by using React for a true dynamic user interface. I used EJS, JavaScript, and CSS for the frontend of this project which gives the illusion of having a dynamic user interface.

## Lessons Learned:

By combining EJS, JavaScript, and CSS, we can achieve a somewhat dynamic user interface for the client.

Passport allows developers to facilitate the login process. It is flexible, and easy to integrate into your ExpressJS code.

This project also helped me have a deeper understanding of CSS and DOM manipulation.
